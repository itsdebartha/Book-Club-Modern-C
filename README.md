# Book-Club-Modern-C
A repository for the codes done before attending the C Book Club

This repository is aimed at the [C-Book Club](https://github.com/r-devel/c-book-club.git)
by the R Contributors. It'll mainly contain codes written by me for practise, and may be
presented in the event.

This is all for the preparation of the 
[R Project Sprint, 2023](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/)
